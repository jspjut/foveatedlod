This repository is a simple G3D shadertoy to adjust level of detail for mip-mapped sampling of a texture based on distance from a "fovea" point.

It is based on the [g3d-starter](https://github.com/jspjut/g3d-starter) and [G3D](http://casual-effects.com/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/guidenewproject.html).
